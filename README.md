# PyDigitalAssistent

Hi,
This digital assistant is built in python. 
User interface was created using the customtkinter library. 
The assistant uses wikipedia and wolframalpha libraries to search data and answer the user's questions.

All the user has to do is write the question in the space provided for it and wait for the answer of the digital assistant.

There is a possibility that the assistant answer by speaking instead of showing the answer.
